# Threadz
A clothing trading and resale website

Threadz is an ecommerce site where users can sell or trade their favorite pieces of clothing.

Our application is still in the developmental phase but we are working to get it up and running so check back soon! We are hoping to implement several user friendly features such as cart shopping, a proper payment system, and we are working toward getting user uploaded content as well.

Our goal is to help build a community of users around the idea of ethical resale by incentivising trade and fair pricing, in an effort to spread cool, affordable clothing to others so they can develop their own style without contributing to fast fashion.

To install the application,

We used React for much of the front end development along with Tailwinds for the CCS stuff, MongoDB to manage databases and standard javascript to apply functionality to the site. The app runs in the terminal and is currently able to compile and be viewed in the browser. We have also deployed the site to Heroku.

We are open to collaborations and we are hoping to implement several changes to the site soon to make it more user friendly across all platforms and media types.  

Right now the only bugs we are dealing with is some questionable file structure and connecting a couple databases but we are hoping to have these minor issues resolved very soon.
